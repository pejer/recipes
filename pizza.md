# Pizza
This recipe should be prepared about 3-4 days before you want to enjoy your pizza. Its because it needs to be in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.

## Ingredients (for 4 pizzas)
Dough:  
* 552g Tipo 00-flour (high protein contents ~ 12.5)
* 359g cold water
* 1.2g fresh yeast
* 16.4g salt (preferably sea salt)

Sauce:  
* One can of San Marzano tomatoes 
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 bay leaf
* Some fresh basil
* A pair of tablespoons of olive oil

## ~4 days before
There is a lot of kneading needed so using a kitchen machine or similar is a good idea.

1. Dissolve the salt in the water
2. Add about 15% of the flour and stir until dissolved
3. Add the yeast and stir until dissolved
4. Add the rest of the flour and knead the dough for 10-15 minutes.

Prepare an airtight container - brush its sides with olive oil, put the dough inside, close the lid and put in the refrigerator at least 48h but 72h or more if you're good at planning ahead.

## At Pi(e) day
4 hours before you're planning on eating them - take the dough out of the refrigerator.  
Split into 4 equal sized balls, make them round by "folding in" the edges.  
Brush some olive oil on a bench or similar surface, and place them with at least 6 cm distance.  
Cover with damp towel or cling film.  
Let them rest & rise - leave them until its time to bake!

## Tomato sauce ~2 hours before
Empty the tomatoes in a pan, crush the tomatoes, its ok if they are still "chunky" (we're not making baby food here!).  
Add the garlic, bay leaf, basil & the olive oil. Let it simmer for a good two hours.  

Add salt & pepper to taste.

## Making the pizzas!
Place the dough ball on a floured surface. With your fingers - press in the middle of the ball and press the fingers out towards the edges. Leave the outer 1cm of the dough untouched - this will become lovely crust once you bake them.

Now, toppings. Try to not overload the pizza - we're making genuine Italian pizza - not that thing you get to cure your hangover on a Sunday afternoon. Few, high quality ingredients is what we're looking for.  
Keep it simple:

* Tomato sauce
* Some parmigiano, a few balls of mozzarella
* Perhaps some olive oil, just a little bit
* Place in a really hot oven
* Once done, add some basil leaves and why not some parma ham...?
