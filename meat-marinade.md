# Lime, coriander & garlic

Enough for about 1kg of meat

* Two limes
* about a pot of coriander (very Swedish measurment :) )
* ~3 cloves of garlic
* Salt & pepper according to taste
* Chilli flakes / cayenne if you want

Just mix it all together, put the meat in the marinade in a bag, try to remove as much air as possible and place it in the fridge.

Be aware that the lime will start to "cook" the meat so you might not want to marinade for too long.

Its advisable to take it out of the fridge about an hour before you'll bbq it.
